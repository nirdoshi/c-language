A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461 of which when digits are reversed number 
remains same.


#include <stdio.h>
 
void main()
{
   int n, reverse = 0, t;
 
   printf("Enter a number to check if it is a palindrome or not\n");
   scanf("%d", &n);
 
   t = n;
 
   while (t != 0)
   {
      reverse = reverse * 10;
      reverse = reverse + t%10;
      t = t/10;
   }
 
   if (n == reverse)
      printf("%d is a palindrome number.\n", n);
   else
      printf("%d isn't a palindrome number.\n", n);
 
}
